# Responsive image (fluid)

Responsive images should automatically adjust to fit the size of the screen.

Images are not naturally fluid: they remain the same size and orientation at all configurations of the viewport, and will be cropped if they become too large for their container. This creates a conundrum when displaying images in a mobile browser: because they remain at their native size, images may be cut off or displayed out-of-scale compared to the surrounding text content as the browser narrows.
