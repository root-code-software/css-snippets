# Text Inputs with animations on error messages

Forms are necessary components of many applications and websites. We use them to log in, purchase items, send feedback, and enter our personal information. Think about the websites you use and how many times you enter information: how often do you run into errors? How frustrating is it to navigate those errors?

Error messages are an indicator of system status: they let users know that a hurdle was encountered and give solutions to fix them. But in order for the error messages to be effective, people need to see them, understand them, and be able to act upon them easily. Visibility of system status is one of Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 usability heuristics. It refers to how well the state of the system is conveyed to its users. Ideally, systems should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

To err is human, and people will make mistakes when using software. An error flow is the sequence of steps that the user must go through in order to correct the error. A thoughtful error flow allows users to easily fix their mistakes and proceed with their tasks.
