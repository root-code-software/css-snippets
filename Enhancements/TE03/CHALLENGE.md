# Style Anchor Active and Hover states

Links in HTML even look different from regular text without any CSS styling at all. They are blue (purple if visited). They are underlined. That’s a link in it’s purest form.

But what if we want to change things up a bit? Perhaps blue doesn’t work with your website’s design. Maybe you have an aversion to underlines. Want to use a different font, change the color, remove the underline and make it all uppercase? Sure, why not?
